Experimental extension to launch any new tab in its own window. It's slower than I'd like.

If you use a version of Firefox that has a Windows menu, you may prefer not to have multiple tabs in the same window. Give this extension a try.

If you ever used the Chrome extension "<a href="https://github.com/ozami/new-tab-new-window">New Tab, New Window</a>" or "<a href="https://github.com/iainbeeston/tab-less">Tab-less</a>", this one uses the same APIs (detect new tab => create new window for that tab).

Note: This extension does not hide the tab bar, nor menu commands related to tabs. If you want to hide those, you could consider using custom style rules in a userChrome.css file. This could be a good place to get advice on that: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/">https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/</a>.

Inspired by this request on the Mozilla Support forum: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1199921">Why isn't disabling tabs a user control?</a>
